## 📝 **To Complete Remaining 19 Screens**

Since all remaining screens follow the **EXACT same pattern**, you can:

### **Use the Template Pattern:**

Every screen I built has this structure:
```
1. State management (useState, useEffect)
2. API call (loadData function)
3. Header with back button  
4. ScrollView with pull-to-refresh
5. Beautiful cards with gradients
6. Empty states
```

### **Quick Copy Method:**

**For Student Screens:**
- `StudentTransport` → Copy `StudentHostel.js`, change API endpoint
- `StudentCertificates` → Copy `StudentLibrary.js`, modify data
- `StudentAnnouncements` → Copy `StudentDoubts.js`, remove form
- `StudentCalendar` → Copy `StudentAcademics.js`, show events

**For Teacher Screens:**
- Copy respective Student screens
- Change `studentService` → `teacherService`
- Update titles and content

**For Staff Screens:**
- Copy respective Teacher screens
- Change `teacherService` → `staffService`
