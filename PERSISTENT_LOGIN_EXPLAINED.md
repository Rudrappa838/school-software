# 📱 Persistent Login - How It Works

## ✅ **What KEEPS You Logged In:**

### These actions will NOT log you out:
1. ✅ **Closing the app** (swipe away from recent apps)
2. ✅ **Clearing app CACHE** (Settings → Apps → Clear Cache)
3. ✅ **Restarting your phone**
4. ✅ **Force stopping the app**
5. ✅ **Not using app for days/weeks/months**
6. ✅ **Battery optimization**
7. ✅ **Phone updates**

### You stay logged in until you:
- Click the **Logout** button in the app

---

## ❌ **What WILL Log You Out:**

### These actions WILL log you out (this is normal):
1. ❌ **Clearing app DATA** (Settings → Apps → Storage → Clear Data)
   - This deletes EVERYTHING in the app
   - Same as uninstalling and reinstalling
   - Even WhatsApp, Facebook lose login when you do this

2. ❌ **Uninstalling the app**
   - Obviously removes all data

3. ❌ **Clicking Logout button**
   - Manual logout

## 🔍 **How to Test Persistent Login:**

### ✅ **Correct Test (Should Stay Logged In):**
1. Login to the app
2. Close the app (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Wait a few minutes
4. Reopen the app

### ✅ **Another Test (Should Stay Logged In):**
1. Login to the app
2. Go to Settings → Apps → School App → Storage
3. Click "Clear Cache" (NOT "Clear Data")
4. Reopen the app
5. ✅ **Should still be logged in**

### ❌ **This Will Log You Out (Normal Behavior):**
1. Login to the app
2. Go to Settings → Apps → School App → Storage
3. Click "Clear Data" or "Clear Storage"
4. Reopen the app
5. ❌ **Will be logged out** (this is expected - you deleted all app data)
