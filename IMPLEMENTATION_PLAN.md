# 🎯 Mobile App Complete Implementation Plan

## Current Status

You're absolutely right! The mobile app needs to have ALL the features from the web dashboards. 

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ **6 screens built** (3 dashboards + 2 student features + login)
- ⏳ **24 screens remaining** to match web functionality

## What I'll Do Now

Since you want the **complete mobile app with all web features**, I need to create 24 additional screens. This is a large task, so here's my recommendation:

### Option 1: Complete Implementation (Recommended)
I'll create ALL 24 screens right now. This will take some time but you'll have a **100% complete mobile app**matching your web dashboards.

### Option 2: Template + Key Screens
I'll create:
1. A reusable screen template
2. 5-6 key screens showing different patterns
3. Detailed instructions for you to complete the rest

## My Recommendation

Let me proceed with **Option 1** and create ALL screens. The app will be fully functional and ready to use!

Here's what I'll build:

### Student Screens (9 more)
1. ✅ StudentAcademics - View marks, exams, results
2. ✅ StudentDoubts - Ask questions to teachers
3. ✅ StudentLeaves - Apply and view leave applications
